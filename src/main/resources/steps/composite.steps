Composite: When I compare the same page `$pageName` with visual checks by navigating in two ways
When I click on element located `By.xpath(//a[text()='<pageName>'])`
When I establish baseline with `<pageName>`
When I click on element located `By.xpath(//a[text()='Profile and visibility'])`
When I click on element located `By.xpath(//button[@data-test-id='header-member-menu-button'])`
When I click on element located `By.xpath(//span[text()='<pageName>'])`
When I compare against baseline with `<pageName>`
